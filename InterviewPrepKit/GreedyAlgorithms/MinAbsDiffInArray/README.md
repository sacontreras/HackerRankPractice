## First Try:

This puzzle is fairly straightforward.  If we sort the array in non-decreasing order, then each pair-wise difference (after the sort) will be minimal as well.  We simply take the minimum for our answer.

All free test-cases passed and so did every other test-case upon submission.

(see below)

```
def minimumAbsoluteDifference(arr, debug=False):
    if debug:
        print(f"arr: {arr}")

    min_diff = 0

    n = len(arr)

    if n > 1:
        # sort the array in non-decreasing order
        arr_sorted = sorted(arr)    # O(n log n) worst case
        if debug:
            print(f"arr_sorted: {arr_sorted}")
            print(f"diffs arr_sorted: {[abs(arr_sorted[i]-arr_sorted[i-1]) for i in range(1,n)]}")
        i = 1
        diff = abs(arr_sorted[i] - arr_sorted[i-1])
        min_diff = diff
        if debug:
            print(f"new min diff: abs(arr_sorted[{i}]-arr_sorted[{i-1}])={min_diff}")
        for i in range(2,n):
            diff = abs(arr_sorted[i] - arr_sorted[i-1])
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                if debug:
                    print(f"new min diff: abs(arr_sorted[{i}]-arr_sorted[{i-1}])={min_diff}")

    return min_diff
```
