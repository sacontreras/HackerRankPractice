## First Try:

This puzzle is very straightforward.  Simply sort the array ($O(n \log n$ complexity), peel off the first $k$ elements, and then take the difference between the last and first elements of those.

This algorithm passed all free test-cases.  Unfortunately, it failed every one of the locked test-cases!

(see below)

```python
def maxMin(k, arr, debug=False):
    if debug:
        print(f"k: {k}, arr: {arr}")

    min_unfairness = 0

    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)
    if debug:
        print(f"arr_sorted: {arr_sorted}")
    min_arr = arr_sorted[:k]
    v_max = min_arr[-1]
    v_min = min_arr[0]
    min_unfairness = v_max - v_min
    if debug:
        print(f"min_arr: {min_arr} --> min unfairness = max({min_arr}) - min({min_arr}) = {v_max} - {v_min} = {min_unfairness}")

    return min_unfairness
```

arr_sorted: [10, 20, 30, 100, 200, 300, 1000]
min_arr: [10, 20, 30] --> min unfairness = max([10, 20, 30]) - min([10, 20, 30]) = 30 - 10 = 20
result: 20
expect: 20
```

min_arr: [1, 2, 3, 4] --> min unfairness = max([1, 2, 3, 4]) - min([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 4 - 1 = 3
result: 3

result: 0
expect: 0
```

## Second Try:

The last algorithm was close but naively neglected to iterate windows of length $k$ from the sorted values.

The new (modified from above) algorithm passed all free test-cases as well as the unlocked test-case 02.  Upon submission, it passed all remaining locked test-cases except for 16.

(see below)

```python
def maxMin(k, arr, debug=False):
    if debug:
        print(f"k: {k}, arr: {arr}")

    min_unfairness = 0

    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)
    
    # now we iterate through arr_sorted, taking windows of length k
    if debug:
        print(f"iterating windows of length {k} from arr_sorted: {arr_sorted}")
    min_diff = None
    for i_start in range(len(arr)-k):
        v_max = arr_sorted[i_start+k-1]
        v_min = arr_sorted[i_start]
        diff = v_max - v_min
        if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            if debug:
                print(f"\tnew min diff {min_diff} from window {arr_sorted[i_start:i_start+k]} (from inclusive index bounds [{i_start},{i_start+k-1}])")

    min_unfairness = min_diff

    return min_unfairness
```

## Third Try:

I made a mistake on the upper-bound on the range of starting indices (corresponding to windows of length $k$ in the sorted array).  I was off by 1.

(see below)

```python
def maxMin(k, arr, debug=False):
    if debug:
        print(f"k: {k}, arr: {arr}")

    min_unfairness = 0

    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)
    
    # now we iterate through arr_sorted, taking windows of length k
    if debug:
        print(f"iterating windows of length {k} from arr_sorted: {arr_sorted}")
    min_diff = None
    for i_start in range(len(arr)-k+1): # upper-bound was off by 1
        v_max = arr_sorted[i_start+k-1]
        v_min = arr_sorted[i_start]
        diff = v_max - v_min
        if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            if debug:
                print(f"\tnew min diff {min_diff} from window {arr_sorted[i_start:i_start+k]} (from inclusive index bounds [{i_start},{i_start+k-1}])")

    min_unfairness = min_diff

    return min_unfairness
```

All remaining locked test-cases are now passing.

## POST-MORTEM:

This was an easy puzzle.  However, it was a great reminder to pay close attention to detail, especially in "off-by-one" considerations.
