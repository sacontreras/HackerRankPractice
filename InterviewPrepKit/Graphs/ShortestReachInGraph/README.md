## First Try:

Again, most of the difficulty in graph puzzles is, well, graphs and the little bit of graph theory understanding required.  We are given that the graph needs to be traversed BFS.  There doesn't seem to be much more to it than that.

The implementation passed all free test-cases.  

But, upon submission, failed locked test-cases 1 and 6 due to "wrong answer" and 2 and 5 due to timeout.

(see below for my full implementation of this algorithm)

## Second Try:

I unlocked test-case 1.  I forget to do a pre-check to make sure the source node has not already been visited.

After this change, the locked test-case (1) passed.

Upon submission, all remaining locked test-cases passed except for locked test-case 5.  This one is still failing due to timeout.

Running this test-case locally passes.  It doesn't take very long but obviously is still too long for the HackerRank interpreter.

## Third Try:

The logic implemented previously is sound.  This changes made in this iteration consisted only of optimization.  

Specifically:
- change `neighbors` collection from `list` to `set`
- changed `nodes_pending_queue` from `list` to `deque`, which probably had the biggest impact... `pop()` occurs in O(1) time

After making the above changes, the final failing test-case 05 passed.

(see below for my full implementation of this algorithm)

```python
from collections import deque

class Graph():
    def __init__(self, n, edge_weight=6, print_distances=True, debug=False):
        self._d_graph = {lbl_node:{'id':lbl_node,'neighbors':set(),'visited':False} for lbl_node in range(n)}
        self.edge_weight = edge_weight
        self.distances = [-1] * len(self._d_graph)
        self.print_distances = print_distances
        self._debug = debug
        if debug:
            self._adj_mat = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

    def connect(self, from_node, to_node):  # these are zero-based
        self._d_graph[from_node]['neighbors'].add(to_node)
        self._d_graph[to_node]['neighbors'].add(from_node)
        if self._debug:
            self._adj_mat[from_node][to_node] = self._adj_mat[to_node][from_node] = 1

    def __traverse_graph_BFS(self, from_node):
        nodes_pending_queue = deque()
        depth = 0
        nodes_pending_queue.append((from_node,depth))

        while len(nodes_pending_queue) > 0:
            current_node, depth = nodes_pending_queue.popleft()
            d_node = self._d_graph[current_node]

            if not d_node['visited']:
                distance = depth * self.edge_weight
                if self._debug:
                    s_tabs = '\t'*depth
                    print(f"{s_tabs}depth: {depth}, visit: {current_node} --> distance from node {from_node} is: {distance}")
                self.distances[d_node['id']] = distance
                d_node['visited'] = True

                for neighbor_node in d_node['neighbors']:
                    d_node_neighbor = self._d_graph[neighbor_node]
                    if not d_node_neighbor['visited']:
                        nodes_pending_queue.append((neighbor_node,depth+1))

        del self.distances[from_node]


    def find_all_distances(self, from_node):   # BFS
        self.__traverse_graph_BFS(from_node)
        if self.print_distances:
            s_result = ' '.join([str(d) for d in self.distances])
            print(s_result)
```


## POST-MORTEM:

Once again, the puzzle itself is very straightforward, even easy, but of course requires knowing a little bit of graph theory.  The pitfalls I encountered here centered around using optimal auxiliary data structures.  (see above commentary)
