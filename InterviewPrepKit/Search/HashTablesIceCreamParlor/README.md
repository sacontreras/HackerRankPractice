## First Try:

This puzzle if fairly straightforward.  Essentially, it can be distilled down to: given target sum \(k\) and a list of integers \(a_i: 1 \le i \le n, a_i > 0\), find \(i \ne j\) such that \(a_i + a_j = k\).

We construct a single dictionary (hash table) keyed by each \(a_i\), with associated value consisting of the list (array) of indices \(1 \le i \le n\) incident with each occurrence of \(a_i\).

We then iterate the keys, each \(a_i\), and check for existence of key \(a_j = k - a_i\).  If it exists, we simply return \(i, j\).

This algorithm passed all free test-cases and, upon submission, all locked test-cases.

(see below)

```
def whatFlavors(cost, money, debug=False):
    if debug:
        print(f"cost: {cost}, money: {money}")

    i_f_2 = i_f_1 = 0

    d_costs = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(cost):
        indices = d_costs.get(c,[])
        indices.append(i)
        d_costs[c] = indices
    if debug:
        print(f"d_costs: {d_costs}")

    for c, indices in d_costs.items():
        if len(indices) > 0:
            need = money - c
            i_c = indices.pop(0)
            if debug:
                print(f"\tcost {c} (at index {i_c+1}) requires complement cost {need}")
            if need in d_costs:
                need_indices = d_costs[need]
                if len(need_indices) > 0:
                    i_need = need_indices.pop(0)
                    i_f_1 = i_c+1
                    i_f_2 = i_need+1
                    if debug:
                        print(f"\t\titem found at index {i_need+1}")
                    break
            if debug:
                print(f"\t\tbut no item at need cost {need} is available")
        
    result = f"{i_f_1} {i_f_2}"
    print(result)

    if debug:
        return result
```

## POST-MORTEM:

There were no real "gotchas" with this puzzle.  Successfully solving on the first try simply required reading the specification closely and then recognizing it could be solved easiest with a hash table.
