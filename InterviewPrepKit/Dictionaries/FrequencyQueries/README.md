## First Try:
This puzzle is fairly easy since it is mostly an exercise in tedium and accounting.  Use two dictionaries for O(1) lookup: one to track frequencies of values, keyed by value, and another to track sets of values keyed by count.  All three free test-cases passed but test-cases 5 through 9, as well as 12, failed.

## POST-MORTEM:

The main "take-aways" here are to always keep in mind complexity and to mind your "spaghetti code".  Dictionaries were vital to a nice time complexity in this case.  In the first two iterations, I neglected to consolidate code into common operations, reasulting in different behavior in different instances.  That is a big fat NO-NO!
