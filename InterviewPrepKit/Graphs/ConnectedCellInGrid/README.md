## First Try:

This was a tedious but not too difficult puzzle.  Again, as with all graph-theory puzzle, the most important facets are, of course, understanding graph theory itself and then understanding whether BFS or DFS should be used.

From there, one must decide what happens when visting a node.

The problem statement requirements dictate those facets.

The only real "gotchas" were:
- understanding that the graph node labels are the grid coordinates
- understanding that, for a given node, its neighbors are those that it is connected to... this does not necessarily mean that the connection is bi-directional; that is, a given source node may be connected to its neighbors (those adjacent cells containing 1s) but if the source node/cell contains a 0, then of course none of its adjacent cells are connected to it (the source cell)

The last statement implies that the graph, therefore, is directed (not undirected).

I took my time developing this and ensuring all free test-cases passed prior to submission and, upon submission, all remaining locked test-cases passed.

(see below for my full implementation of this algorithm)
